# Knets Enhanced Multi-Layer Location Tracking System

## Overview
This package contains the complete enhanced location tracking system for Knets family device management. The system implements a 4-tier location detection approach that ensures parents can always obtain child device location regardless of device settings.

## Location Methods

### 1. GPS Location (±3-5m accuracy)
- Direct GPS provider access
- Best for outdoor locations
- Requires location permissions

### 2. Network Location (±10-100m accuracy)  
- WiFi access points and cellular towers
- Works indoors and urban areas
- Good balance of accuracy and availability

### 3. Cell Tower Triangulation (±150-500m accuracy)
- Direct cell tower data collection
- Works without location services enabled
- Coverage anywhere with cell signal

### 4. IP Geolocation (±5-50km accuracy)
- Internet IP address geolocation
- Universal fallback method
- Works on any internet connection

## Smart Fallback System
The system automatically tries methods in priority order: GPS → Network → Cell Tower → IP Geolocation. If one method fails, it seamlessly falls back to the next available option.
